# Advent_Of_Code_2024
Repository containing all of my Advent of Code 2024 work

I toyed with the idea of doing this year in Golang, but honestly looking back at my poor attempt at Advent Of Code last year I'd like to redeem myself with Rust building on what I have learned in the past year.

Each day will have it's ow README.md with the problem statement as well a my reflections on the problem and how I went about solving it.

I will be quite busy this year travelling and visiting family, so I doubt I will be on time, but I am hoping to make it further and require less assistance to write the code.

I will be doing this challenge with copilot off to really stretch my brain, This will be good practice in architecting my own solutions, and I am looking forward to doing that this year.
